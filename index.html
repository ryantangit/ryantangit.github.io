        <strong>Ryan Tan</strong> is a UC Berkeley alum pursuing an M.S. in
        Software Engineering at San Jose State University. He is currently a
        Software Engineering Intern at Institutional Shareholder Services'
        Innovation Lab, focusing on developing AI solutions for document
        analysis.
      </p>
      <h2 class="content-subheader">Early Life</h2>
      <p>
        Born in Guangdong Province, Ryan Tan spent most of his early childhood
        in China. He doesn't remember much but recalls some faint memories of
        memories of playing Rock, Paper, Scissors and tag with schoolmates. In
        the late 2000s, Ryan and his family immigrated to the state of
        California in the United States. He attended middle and high school in
        the Bay Area, where P.E. was his favorite class.
      </p>
      <h2 class="content-subheader">Adult Life and Education</h2>
      <p>
        Ryan attended the University of California, Berkeley in 2018 and
        graduated with a Computer Science undergraduate degree in 2021. During
        his freshman year in college, he was on the school's Hearthstone Esports
        team. It was around this time when he also became a naturalized citizen
        of the United States. In his sophomore year, the COVID-19 pandemic shut
        down the school campus, and he returned home to finish the remaining
        semesters of his college online. He considered CS61C (Computer
        Architecture) to be one of the more enjoyable classes at school. His
        favorite library was the air-conditioned Mainstack. His favorite campus
        bathroom was the one on Moffitt's fifth floor.
      </p>
      <p>
        After completing his undergrad, Ryan moved to Salt Lake City, Utah to
        work as a software consultant for the State of Utah's DMV. His primary
        responsiblity was FastQ, the queuing system used in six major offices
        scattered across Utah. It was his first time in a long time being far
        away from the Bay Area and to his surprise, he really enjoyed Salt Lake
        City. While he was working, however, his mother had some health issues
        and he decided to move back where he can be closer with his family.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2024, he accepted an offer to enroll in San Jose State University as
        a Master in Software Engineering. He worked as an Instructional Teaching
        Assistant for a graduate Operating System course. He is still currently
        enrolled and researching artificial intelligence usage in academia for
        his master project. His favorite floor of King's Library is the sixth
        floor.
      </p>
      <p>
        Alongside school, Ryan is also an intern at Internation Shareholder
        Services' Innovation Lab. His responsiblity mostly consists of
        developing internal AI-integrated tools for document analysis and data
        annotations.
