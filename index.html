          >UC Berkeley</a
        >
        alum pursuing an M.S. in Software Engineering at

          >San Jose State University</a
        >. He is currently a Software Engineering Intern at Institutional

      </p>
      <h2 class="content-subheader">Early Life</h2>
      <p>
        Born in
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guangdong">Guangdong Province</a
        >, Ryan Tan spent most of his early childhood in China. He doesn't
        remember much, but recalls some faint memories of memories of playing
        Rock, Paper, Scissors and tag with schoolmates. In the late 2000s, Ryan
        and his family immigrated to the state of
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California">California</a> in the
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States">United States</a>.
        He attended middle and high school in the
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Bay_Area"
          >Bay Area</a
        >, where P.E. was his favorite class.
      </p>
      <h2 class="content-subheader">Adult Life and Education</h2>
      <p>
        Ryan attended the
        <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_Berkeley"
          >University of California, Berkeley</a
        >
        in 2018 and graduated with a Computer Science undergraduate degree in
        2021. During his freshman year, he was on the school's
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearthstone">Hearthstone</a>
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esports">Esports</a> team. It was
        around this time that he also became a
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naturalization">naturalized</a>
        citizen of the
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States">United States</a>.
        In his sophomore year, the
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19">COVID-19</a> pandemic
        shut down the campus, and he returned home to finish his remaining
        college semesters online. He considered CS61C (Computer Architecture) to
        be one of his more enjoyable classes. His favorite library was the
        air-conditioned Mainstack, and his favorite campus bathroom was the one
        on Moffitt's fifth floor.
      </p>
      <p>
        After completing his undergraduate degree, Ryan moved to
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_Lake_City">Salt Lake City</a
        >, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utah">Utah</a>, to work as a
        software consultant for the State of Utah's
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_motor_vehicles"
          >DMV</a
        >. His primary responsibility was FastQ, the queuing system used in six
        major offices scattered across
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utah">Utah</a>. This was his
        first time in a long time being far away from the
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Bay_Area"
          >Bay Area</a
        >, and to his surprise, he really enjoyed
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_Lake_City">Salt Lake City</a
        >. However, while he was working, his mother experienced some health
        issues, and he decided to move back to be closer to his family.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2024, Ryan accepted an offer to enroll in
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Jose_State_University"
          >San Jose State University</a
        >
        as a Master in Software Engineering student. He also worked as an
        Instructional Teaching Assistant for a graduate Operating System course.
        He's currently still enrolled and researching the use of artificial
        intelligence in academia for his master's project. His favorite floor of
        King's Library is the sixth floor.
      </p>
      <p>
        During the summer of 2025, Ryan was also an intern at Internation
        Shareholder Services' Innovation Lab in
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menlo_Park,_California"
          >Menlo Park</a
        >. His main responsiblity was developing
        AI-powered tools for document analysis and data annotations.
      </p>
      <p>
        Currently, he is now back in school to working on his Master's Project
        with a focus on Agentic AI.
