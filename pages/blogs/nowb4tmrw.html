    <h1>Now Is Now, Before Was Before, And Tomorrow Who Knows?</h1>
    <h3><em> Ryan Tan </em> , <time>May 17th, 2025</time></h3>

    <h2>Introduction / TL;DR</h2>
    <p>
      This sentence epitomizes a new approach I take towards life. The concept
      is not foreign, and probably is more of a cliche at this point. Here are
      similiar concepts you probably heard about already:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Carpe Diem</li>
      <li>Live in the moment!</li>
      <li>What would you do if today was your last day?</li>
      <li>
        Best time to plant a tree was 10 years ago, second best time is now.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      It was easy to dismiss this concept when I was younger. Most of my worries
      were more in the areas of beating bosses on Bloodborne with different
      builds<i> [whirligig saw ftw]</i>, or reaching Legend rank in
      Hearthstone<i> [cubelock abuser]</i>. But as I've grown older, time seems
      to move faster than ever before. And with acceleration of time, worries
      about the future and regrets about the past were regular occurrences.
      These feelings often bogged down my mood and made me spiral into despair.
      So I decided to say F*ck it! It is what it is, I'll make the most of the
      present and that's all that matters in the end.
    </p>

    <h2>Importance</h2>
    <p>
      As an individual who struggles with self-forgiveness, this sentence
      enables me to let go of my shame and worries. It serves as a daily
      reminder for self-improvement in all facets of my life. By emphasizing
      <strong> is </strong>, <strong> was </strong>, and
      <strong> who knows </strong> while saying the sentence, I am letting go of
      the past and future to focus on the present.
    </p>

    <h3>Before Was Before</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>"Ah, if I only had more time that day I ..."</li>
      <li>"Ah, if only I had taken better care of ... when I was younger"</li>
      <li>"Ah, if I could redo that day when I ..."</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      It is easy to voice regrets about mistakes or failures of the past. I
      certainly do. There is nothing wrong with recognizing your own
      shortcomings. If anything, Regret is the greatest catalyst for growth. You
      know you've messed up, and you know what you should have done better. But
      by the same token, you are also lamenting the time lost in your prior
      ignorance.
    </p>
    <p>
      For me, lamenting the time lost is intoxicating. It is, after all, an
      existential struggle against the perpetual motion of time. Time can only
      move forward, there is no stopping it. Grasping with something out of my
      control incites fear, confusion, and anxiety. Instead of taking the next
      steps to become a better version of myself, I am stuck looking back at my
      previous steps: the different paths I could have taken, analyzing what I
      could have done to get to where I am faster, obsessing over every minute
      detail. Soon enough, I become overly critical of my past self. Instead,
      what I should think is "Dang, I am capable of more, and I know how to do
      it", turn my head around, lift one leg forward, and take my first step
      forward. Therefore, by saying, "before was before", I am accepting my past
      as my own experiences that will shape me into becoming a better man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reflecting on the past is crucial to self-improvement. But reflecting
      shouldn't be all there is to it. Extract the shortcomings of the past as
      lessons that are applicaple in the present. After all, what happened in
      the past stays in the past, but in your next moments, you are in control
      of how you spend your time.
    </p>

    <h3>Tomorrow Who Knows</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>"What will I look like in 10 years?"</li>
      <li>"What would the stock market be in the next quarter?"</li>
      <li>"When will we go to Mars?"</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      We are always so eager to know what the future has in store for us. This
      is evident in popularity of fortune telling, and in more modern times,
      model predictions. I believe the reason is, once again, our existential
      struggle against time. If time can only move forward, then naturally, we
      want to be better prepared for when the future comes. Be it an investment
      opportunity, a new trend, or the next Covid-19. But we should also take
      into account the best way to be prepared is focus on the now.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the last years of studying software engineering, one thing I've come to
      realize extraordinary software projects are born out of a necessity of the
      now. The original Linux [or GNU/Linux] kernel was born out Linus Torvalds'
      frustration with licensing of Minix, a UNIX-like Operating system.
      Furthermore, Torvalds stated the kernel was a hobby project. There were no
      lofty goals of Linux being in virtually every aspects of technology.
      Because quite frankly, how would Torvald, or anyone in his shoe, have
      known? The same can be said for Git, which is a versioning tool most
      software engineers are familiar with. This tool spawned from a
      disagreement between the Linux Kernel maintainers and the company that
      owned Bitkeeper, the original tool used by the maintainers. So Torvalds
      and the Linux Kernel developers went ahead and made their own versioning
      tool for their project: Git. Fast forward today, Git is the most popular
      version control tool used, with Git hosting services effectively being the
      go-to places to view code projects. Again, who would have predicted that
      tool would be used by the majority of the computing world? There are many
      more instances in which the project's scope has long outgrown the original
      intent.
    </p>

    <p>
      Look for opportunities in the current to improve the status quo. There is
      no use in trying to wrangle with what's on the horizon tomorrow. The
      future is merely a byproduct of what we do in the now.
    </p>

    <h3>Now is Now</h3>

    <p>
      When time passes, it feels as if I have lost something I can never get
      back. That is the reality of life, no amount of wealth or power can bring
      back the seconds I spent typing this sentence out. But at the same time, I
      am invigorated with new time. What I choose to do in the next seconds is
      up to me. I can add a smiley face like this :) to my sentence. I can spel
      wordds incorrrectly. I can even not write.
    </p>
    <p>
      The point is, I am in control of how I spend the <strong> now </strong>.
      Every second, a new opportunity to be healthier, to be more disciplined,
      to make progress on a problem. Take action, or don't. Listen to what my
      mind, body and soul are trying to tell me, and simply do.
    </p>
    <p>The present is the only time we have control over.</p>
    <p>
      Then at some point, the present will be the past. We have influenced our
      past.
    </p>
    <p>
      And at the same time, the future will be the present. We can deal with
      whatever future brings in the present.
    </p>
    <p>We are in control of our lives through the now.</p>

    <h2>How I Realized</h2>
    <p>
      I was journaling at the library to clear out a lethargic feeling I felt
      all morning. On that particular day, I felt this sense of urgency in
      needing to "have it all figured out". I felt inadequate from comparing
      myself to a more idealistic version of myself. The feeling was
      demoralizing. Then the midst of journaling, I had grown extrodinarily
      drowsy. I had closed my eyes before I realized and napped. When I woke up,
      two things popped into my mind.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        I made an ink splotch from holding my pen in place too long while I
        slept.
      </li>
      <li>
        A quote: "Forgive and move on. Now is now, before was before, tomorrow,
        who knows."
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>So yeah, all it took was one good nap for a moment of clarity.</p>
